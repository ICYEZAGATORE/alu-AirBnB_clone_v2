This project is an extension of the AirBnB clone, focusing on improving its functionality and transitioning the storage engine from FileStorage to DBStorage using MySQL and SQLAlchemy. Key updates include enabling object creation through the command interpreter with specified parameters, developing unit tests for all implemented features, and ensuring compatibility with MySQL databases. It also involves setting up MySQL development and test environments, managing database users, and refining the deletion of objects. Moreover, the project introduces support for filtering objects by class in the storage engine and a new method for relationship management between states and cities using SQLAlchemy. The environment variable HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE allows switching between file and database storage, ensuring the system can operate with both storage options. Overall, the enhancements aim to bring improved flexibility, scalability, and testing to the AirBnB clone system.
